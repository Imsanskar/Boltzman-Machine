# Boltzman Machine
A Boltzmann Machine is a network of symmetrically connected, neuronlike units that make stochastic decisions about whether to be on or off. 


# Restricted Boltzman Machine(RBM)
A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a special type of a Boltzmann machine where the pair interactions are restricted to be between an observed set of units and an unobserved set of units. Restricted boltzman machine is a bipartite graph, where hidden units are connected to visible units and there are no inter connection with in the layer.
